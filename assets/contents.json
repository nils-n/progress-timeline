      "content": "Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman, granting states the power to reject recognition of same-sex marriages. Consequently, this resulted in the denial of federal protections, privileges, access to employment benefits for partners, inheritance rights, immigration and residency rights, and complications with joint tax returns. In summary, a single stroke of a pen by one individual eliminated the rights of millions of people, effectively erasing their ability to enjoy equal treatment and opportunities in various aspects of life.",

      "content": "The Stonewall Inn was a well-known gay bar where individuals could gather to socialize, dance, and enjoy the jukebox. The establishment had Mafia protection through regular payoffs, as the Mafia had invested in the bar. The police raided the bar, suspecting involvement in bootlegging liquor. Patrons were required to present identification, and those who were not arrested were escorted out. A crowd began to gather outside, and as more people arrived, they were met with thrown beer bottles. Gradually, the situation escalated into a riot, with some arrested individuals being freed by the enraged crowd. The following night, although smaller confrontations between the LGBTQ+ community and the police occurred, the riot had subsided. Those who were present became members of the Gay Liberation Front, continuing to fight for the rights and equality of the queer community.",
