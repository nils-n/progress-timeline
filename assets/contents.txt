The committee was established in Germany on May 15, 1897, shortly after Magnus Hirschfield secured the release of Oscar Wilde, who had been imprisoned for homosexuality. Hirschfield noticed the alarming number of his homosexual patients contemplating suicide due to societal condemnation of their natural desires. In an effort to challenge the prevailing belief that homosexuality was unnatural and criminal, they collected over 5,000 signatures, including those of prominent figures such as Leo Tolstoy and Albert Einstein, advocating for the repeal of Paragraph 175, the law that criminalized same-sex relationships.



2. 1919: Magnus Hirschfeld opens the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin, promoting the understanding and acceptance of homosexuality.

On July 6th, Magnus Hirschfield inaugurated the groundbreaking "Institute of Sexual Science" in Berlin's Tiergarten district, making it the world's first institution of its kind. With a diverse team of over 40 professionals specializing in research, sexual counseling, venereal disease treatment, and public sexual education, the institute also featured a museum showcasing sexual artifacts, examination rooms, and a lecture hall. Providing free advice to the public, the institute conducted over 18,000 consultations in its inaugural year, benefiting more than 3,500 individuals. Those with limited financial resources received complimentary medical treatment at the institute.



3. 1924: The Society for Human Rights is established in Chicago, marking the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States.

Inspired by Magnus Hirschfield, Henry Gerber, originally from Bavaria and later a resident of the United States, submitted an application to establish the Society for Human Rights on December 10, 1924, in Chicago. Although he published only a few issues before the local police presented a charter that led to the society's closure in 1925, the charges were eventually dropped. Unfortunately, Gerber was financially ruined due to the legal fees. Despite these setbacks, he persevered and continued to write about homosexuality for various publications.



4. 1933: The Nazi regime in Germany initiates the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals, leading to arrests, imprisonment, and violence

During the Nazi regime, a student group aligned with the regime marched to the Institute for Sexual Science, looting its library and archives, followed by the burning of books and files. Within months, the institute was compelled to close. Henry Gerber, affected by these events, left Germany and relocated to France. The Nazi regime continued its relentless campaign against male homosexuality from 1933 to 1945, resulting in over 100,000 arrests and approximately 50% of them being convicted, often leading to imprisonment in concentration camps. In June 1935, the Nazis intensified their efforts by amending Paragraph 175, effectively banning sexual relationships between men. The campaign further escalated in 1936 under the leadership of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.



5. 1948: Alfred Kinsey publishes “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,” a groundbreaking study that includes research on homosexuality. 1950s

Front page of book: Sexua Behaviour in the Human Male

Alfred Kinsey, a renowned sexologist, gained recognition for his groundbreaking work on human sexuality. He proposed that everyone falls on a bisexual scale ranging from 0 (heterosexual) to 6 (homosexual). Kinsey published two influential books known as "The Kinsey Reports":
In 1948, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" was released, based on 5,300 interviews.
In 1953, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" followed, based on 6,000 interviews.
Through his research, Kinsey discovered that approximately 11.6% of males aged 20-35 fell at rating 3 on his scale, indicating some level of bisexuality. The corresponding figure for females was approximately 7%. These findings challenged prevailing societal notions of sexual orientation.



6. 1952: The American Psychiatric Association includes homosexuality in the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)

This manual had the objective of establishing consistent criteria and terminology for psychiatric disorders, resulting in the classification of homosexuality as a "sociopathic personality disturbance." It encompassed various forms of sexual deviation, such as "homosexuality, transvestism, fetishism, and others." The inclusion of these behaviors in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) aimed to acknowledge them as disorders rather than moral transgressions. This laid the groundwork for future investigations on homosexuality by clinicians, shaping the understanding and study of this topic in the field of psychology. 



7. 1969: The Stonewall riots in New York City ignite the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, marking a turning point for activism.

The Plaque at the Stonewall In

The Stonewall Inn was a well-known gay bar where individuals could gather to socialize, dance, and enjoy the jukebox. The establishment had Mafia "protection" through regular payoffs, as the Mafia had invested in the bar. The police raided the bar, suspecting involvement in bootlegging liquor. Patrons were required to present identification, and those who were not arrested were escorted out. A crowd began to gather outside, and as more people arrived, they were met with thrown beer bottles. Gradually, the situation escalated into a riot, with some arrested individuals being freed by the enraged crowd. The following night, although smaller confrontations between the LGBTQ+ community and the police occurred, the riot had subsided. Those who were present became members of the Gay Liberation Front, continuing to fight for the rights and equality of the queer community.



8. 1973: The American Psychiatric Association removes homosexuality from the list of mental disorders in the DSM

John E. Fryer Historical Marker

In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) voted on the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. Out of the votes cast, 5,854 were in favor of removal, while 3,810 were in favor of retaining the classification. This decision led to homosexuality being shifted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), and instead labeled as "sexual orientation disturbance" until its complete removal in 1987. However, it is worth noting that the new definition proposed by Spitzer was criticized for its homophobic bias. Years later, Spitzer publicly resigned from the APA nomenclature committee due to the recognition of his own homophobic views.



9. The first cases of what would later be identified as AIDS are reported, leading to a devastating impact on the LGBTQ+ community.

On June 5, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report highlighting five cases of Pneumocystis Pneumonia among gay men, although the disease was already known within the LGBT+ community. Lawrence Mass, a journalist, was the first to write about the emerging epidemic in an article titled "Disease Rumors Largely Unfounded" published in the gay newspaper The New York Native. By the end of 1981, there were already 270 reported cases of severe immune deficiency, with 121 deaths among gay men. At this point, the disease was still not fully understood and lacked an official name. Finally, on September 24, the CDC named it AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). By 1985, at least one HIV infection had been reported in every region of the world.



10. 1996: President Bill Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages
./assets/images/Bill_Clinton_signing.jpeg
Bill Clinton Signing

Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman, granting states the power to reject recognition of same-sex marriages. Consequently, this resulted in the denial of federal protections, privileges, access to employment benefits for partners, inheritance rights, immigration and residency rights, and complications with joint tax returns. In summary, a single stroke of a pen by one individual eliminated the rights of millions of people, effectively erasing their ability to enjoy equal treatment and opportunities in various aspects of life.



11. The Supreme Court of the United States strikes down sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, decriminalizing same-sex sexual activity

A significant turning point came in 2003 with the landmark case Lawrence v. Texas, which resulted in the decriminalization of homosexuality throughout the United States, although by then only 36 states had repealed their anti-sodomy laws. However, Louisiana continued to classify same-sex relations as a crime under its legal definition. It was not until June 26, 2005, with the case Obergefell v. Hodges, that marriage equality became the law of the land in all 50 states. American Samoa took an additional two years to follow suit. This marked the beginning of a transformative journey towards greater LGBTQ+ rights and recognition.


12. The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” (DADT) policy, which prohibited openly gay individuals from serving in the U.S. military, is repealed.

The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (DADT) policy, which suppressed the rights of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, was finally terminated on September 20, 2011. Under DADT, they were compelled to conceal their sexual orientation, as any acknowledgment of their identity or engagement in "homosexual conduct" could result in discharge from the military. The abolishment of this policy marked a significant milestone, providing protection against discrimination for gay servicemen and servicewomen. This change allowed them to serve openly without fear of reprisal based on their sexual orientation, fostering a more inclusive and equitable environment within the military.



13. 2020: The Supreme Court of the United States rules in Bostock v. Clayton County that federal employment discrimination protections extend to LGBTQ+ individuals

The Civil Rights Act in the United States was designed to safeguard employees against discrimination, but its application varied across states, with only 21 providing comprehensive protection. However, when Gerald Bostock expressed interest in a gay softball league, he was terminated from his job in Clayton County, Georgia. The subsequent court ruling established that it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against individuals based on their transgender status or sexual orientation, as protected by Title VII and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This landmark victory represents a significant milestone for the LGBTQ+ community, affirming that people should not be judged based on their identity or whom they love.
